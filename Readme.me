Football prediction

home_side advantage (missing)

curved_rating increment i.e. drop>rise for goal_diff
goal prediction by: defense*attack rating, using possion distribution for goal probability.

Algorithm work great in  
AHCh count the final one
AHCh result(prediction side): -1,-0.75,0.25
AHCh result(home side):-1,-0.75,1,0.75,-0.25
Above result skipped every Draw prediction
